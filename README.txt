My 2Sum program runs and compiles as it should. I tested for different scenarios of different arrys and all work as intended. My implementation starts with selection
sort to sort the array. It then uses a similar implimentation as selection sort to find the 2 sum, but since the array is sorted, we can stop at multiple points:
when the index is greater than the target, when the sum is greater than the target. Because it is sorted, we can exit the loops early and finish the program quicker.
I didn't run into many issues when writing this code and as such didn't get help for any part.
